## Introduction ##

Hunk.Finance is a community-governed Decentralized Autonomous Organization with four stages plan that will be implemented within 30 days from project launch. We want to make DAO that will benefit from combination of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and High Frequency Trading (HFT).

We will run a presale of HULK tokens in a few days. As we wrote before, we plan to sell 10,000 HULKs at a presale price of 0.1 ETH (or 1 ETH=10 HULKs)
